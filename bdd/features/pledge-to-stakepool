Feature: Pledge to a stakepool

    Rule: Pledging transaction can be constructed
  
        Scenario: Valid case
            Given there is a stakepool for which I am the owner
            When I provide details of my pledging intent (consider using 'data table' with valid values)
            Then exchange can construct a transaction for my pledge
            And the delegation transaction matches my pledging intent
	
    	Scenario: Invalid case - no enough funds to pledge
            Given ...
	
    	Scenario: Invalid case - stakepool not registered
            Given ...


    Rule: Pledging transaction can be submitted
  
        Scenario: Valid pledging transaction
            Given there is a stakepool for which I am the owner
            And exchange has constructed a valid pledging transaction
            When exchange submits the transaction
            Then a successful response is returned
            And pledge can be proven(?)

        Scenario: Invalid case â€“ stakepool not registered
		    Given exchange has constructed a delegation transaction using a stakepool id that is not registered
		    When exchange submits the transaction
    		Then an error is returned
    		And pledge is not accepted on the blockchain
